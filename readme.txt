project:
Pick stocks from 3 different companies and plot the open, close and volume of stocks for each of the companies. 
Think about how you want to build the visualizations (a few metrics in one plot or not, volumes of a few companies in one plot or not).
Experiment with this and explain the story behind your visualizations. 
Continue working with the 3 companies you chose. Create plots for each of them which will help you say something about the seasonality in the closing prices for these companies
